## How to set up.

Clone the project to your computer using Git, or download the ZIP file and unzip it into a folder.
Run `generate-key-char.py` first. A file named `key-characters.json` should appear. **Do not** delete this file.
Then, run `index.py` and follow the prompts.

> This was developed with Python 3.9.1, I'm not sure on how it would run on older versions. If it doesn't work on your version, let me know!

## How to use:

A black command line window will appear when you run `index.py`. Just follow the prompts.
